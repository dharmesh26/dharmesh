			Hello,Coursera. Here, you are at the module two solutions. In this you have to create one 
			html responsice page like as dummy provided at the end of the week. THe constraint over it
			is that you don't have to use any king of the frameworks of css or jave script like as 
			bootstrap. so, for this you can use the media queries to define up the responsiveness using
			float component. But you have to put title section to be kept on right no matter of the 
			layout or the size of the device and the content.This you can implement using the absolute 
			and relative positioning method using offsets togrther.
